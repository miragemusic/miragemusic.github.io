<b>Calle Chapo Márquez, Colonia Federal, Tijuana</b>

Our street hugs up on the border fence. All barbwire and human/drug detection gadgetry.
There's a guy who guards the corner in an office chair day in, day out. Claims to be a
narco plant but is friendlier than your average Tijuana block P.D.
                             
                           (A real feat given the constant electronic noise in the air: 
                               chirps and alarms and radio chatter, not to mention the 
                               mosquitos and confused gringos (note: alt name idea for 
                                                     neighborhood, "Little Amazonia"))

We certainly haven't helped; our music-making hours straddle the p.m. - a.m. divide.
This never stopped him from reminiscing aloud to us about "el tiempo de los coyotes"-
c.a. late 80's-90's- when buildings on the street were under cartel control and harbored 
soon-to-be immigrants and smugglers before their slow, catastrophic crawl into the 
Other Side. 

He says the street sits on ground permeated with narrow tunnels- dozens of them- 
and the whole thing is due to become a canyon at any moment. 

And so this collection of songs is, in some way, a talisman against earthquakes and a 
prayer for all fellow termite ppl of the world, clinging to the comforts of nighttime, 
living for la paz y luz al fin del túnel.
